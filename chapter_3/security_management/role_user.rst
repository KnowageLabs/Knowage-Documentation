User profile and role
############

Knowage users are defined by:

- identities,
- roles,
- profiles.

The *identity* of a user consists of all data used to identify that user, i.e., a username and a password, as well as a human readable full name.

The *profile* of a user consists of a set of properties called attributes, describing general information about the user, e.g., age and gender, but also domain-specific properties, such as the organizational unit to which he belongs. Some attributes, such as name and email, are defined by default in Knowage. Others can be added by the model administrator, as explained in the following sections.

The *role* of a user represents a categorization of a group of users. These roles may correspond to specific positions in the company, e.g., “general manager” or a “sales director”, or to a position with respect to the BI project, e.g., “data administrator” and “BI developer”. Different users may have the same role, as well as the same user may have multiple roles.

You will not have grants to create new roles or users, but you are asked to match them during document profilation phases. In the following we are going to describe the elements needed for adding parameters. This elements involves profilation too. To conclude we will see how to manage accessibility while creating a document.
