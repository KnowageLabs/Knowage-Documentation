An important topic related to the visibility on documents and data according to the roles and profiles of the end users, is the **Behavioural Model**.
The behavioural model is based on four main concepts:

-  *user profile*, defining the user roles and attributes;
-  *repository rights*, defining the users rights in terms of document accessibility;
-  *analytical drivers*, defining which data of a document can be shown to the user;
-  *presentation environment* settings, defining how the user can reach and run his own documents.

and mainly answers the following questions:

-  *WHO* uses the business intelligence solution (user profile);
-  *WHAT* is visible to users, in terms of documents and data (repository rights and analytical drivers);
-  *HOW* users work with their documents (analytical drivers and presentation environment settings).
