KNOWAGE is the professional open source suite for modern business analytics over traditional sources and big data systems. KNOWAGE is the new brand for SpagoBI project: this new brand marks the value of the well-known open source business intelligence suite after significant functional and technological transformations and a new offering model. The suite is composed of two main modules and four different plug-ins, each one conceived for a specific analytical domain.

The two modules are:

- ER (enterprise reporting), to produce and distribute static reports
- SI (smart intelligence), the usual business intelligence on structured data, but more oriented to self-service capabilities and agile prototyping

The four plug-ins that can added to Smart Intelligence module are:

- SD (smart data), to combine Solr index with other data sources and provide faceted views and full text search
- LI (location intelligence), to handle spatial data providing multi-layer maps where geographic information joins traditional data shown by other standard widgets
- PM (performance management), to define KPIs with thresholds, schedule their evaluation and publish them natively in a widget
- CA (custom analytics), to add what-if capabilities e take full advantage of R/python embedding possibilities

KNOWAGE supports a modern vision of the data analytics, providing new self-service capabilities that give autonomy to the end-user, now able to build his own analysis and explore his own data space, also combining data that come from different sources.
