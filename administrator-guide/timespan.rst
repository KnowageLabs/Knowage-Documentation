Most of times, a technical user develops a business solution for the use and consumption of a third end-user. In the contest of self-service capability of Knowage, when business models are available for allowing the end-users to query data, it is possible to arrange time or temporal intervals. Those will be used by the end-users when querying data using the QbE interface.
