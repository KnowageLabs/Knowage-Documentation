The Timespan functionality is available under the Catalog section of Knowage main menu. When clicking on menu item "Timespan", Knowage redirects the user to the list of periods, if any was already set.

To configure a new period the user must click on the red plus icon on the top right corner of Timespan list area. After clicking on the button the half right part of the page will display the form to fill in all necessary information. In particular, the technical user is asked to assign a name to the new timespan, to specify if it is a time or temporal type period. To associate a category for profiling issues and finally to define the start and the end time or the start and end date, if it is a time or temporal timespan respectively.
