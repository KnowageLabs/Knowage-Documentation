KPIs
~~~~

In this section we describe how to manage the import/export of KPIs between two tenants.

The user must enter Knowage as administrator of source tenant and click on **Import/Export KPIs** from Server Manager menu panel.

.. figure:: media/image77.png

    KPIs Import/Export from menu

The page contains the **Export** and the **Import** tab, where the user can select the KPIs for the export/import respectively.

.. figure:: media/image78.png

    KPIs Import window

Letâ€™s start from the export feature. The user must check the KPIs for the export using the tab interface. He/she can add some more functionalities to the export action, namely:

- to include targets,
- to include those scorecards related to the selected KPIs,
- to include schedulations.

Finally click on the red download button to get a zipped folder that will be used to conclude the export.

.. figure:: media/image79.png

    Start export button

Once the .zip file is downloaded, the user has to switch tenant (the one on which he/she wants to do the import). As admin of the destination tenant, enter the Import/Export KPIs functionality and move to the Import tab.

The user must therefore browse the personal folder to catch the zipped folder and click on the red upload button just aside, as shown in the following figure.

.. figure:: media/image82.png

    Import tab

Referring to the following image, the user has to specify if:

-  to overwrite the existing KPIs and their related formulas
-  to import targets,
-  to import scorecards,
-  to import schedulations.

.. figure:: media/image83.png

    Import KPIs settings

Once the import is started, the GUI leads the user to finalize the import procedure. In particular, the user is asked to map data sources correctly (Figure below).

.. figure:: media/image84.png

    Mapping data sources

The process ends successfully when the wizard shows up as following.

.. figure:: media/image85.png

    Import KPIs ended successfully

Analytical Drivers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This option allows to import/export the analytical drivers and their related LOV.

.. figure:: media/image86.png

    Import/Export of analytical drivers

As shown in Figure above, the window contains the Export and the Import tab. Use the Export tab to download the .zip file to be used in the import process.

To produce such a file, the user has to log in as administrator of the source tentant. Then he has to assign a name to the export, check the analytical drivers of interest and click on the red download button available at the top right corner of the page. Note that it is possible to slim down the research of the analytical drivers by filtering on their data of creation.

Switch tenant and log in as administrator. Use the Import tab to upload the zipped folder and finalize the import.

Use the GUI to upload the zipped folder, to specify if to overwrite on the existing analytical drivers or add missing. Then click on next and continue by mapping roles among tenants and data sources.

The process ends with a message containing the information about the import.

Glossary
~~~~~~~~

The export/import of glossary allows the user to align glossaries among tenants.

.. figure:: media/image90.png

    Export/Import of glossaries window

There are the two tabs of Export and Import. The user is asked to select the glossaries to export and to type a name that will be assigned to the zipped folder. The user can help himself/herself by using the filter on data (of creation of the glossary).

Once the user has got the zipped folder he/she must switch tenant and enter as its admin. Then select the import tab from the Export/Import main window.

.. figure:: media/image91.png

    Import of glossaries

The user must use the arrows to indicate the glossaries he/she wants to import in the target tenant. No further information are needed to end the process. Then the user has to enter the target tenant as administrator and use the import tab to finalize the import.

Catalog
~~~~~~~~

This functionality allows to Export/Import the following elements

-  Data sets,
-  Business models,
-  Mondrian catalogs,
-  Layers,
-  SVG files.

The steps to perform the Export/Import are equal to those seen in the previous sections. Namely, the user has to enter the **Import/Export catalog** menu item from Server Manager menu panel. The window will contain the Import and Export tabs. The export tab is used to produce the zip folder to be imported in the tenant of interest. Note that the user can apply a temporal filter to help him/her to look up elements in the list.

.. figure:: media/image92.png

    Import of catalog

The import requires the zipped folder to be uploaded, to check the elements to import, to map roles among tenants and to map datasources.
